# Logistic Regression

**Logistic regression**, which is a **classification model**, i.e. it will help you make predictions in cases where the output is a **categorical variable**. Since logistic regression is the most easily interpretable of all classification models, it is very commonly used in various industries such as banking, healthcare, etc.

## Introduction: Univariate Logistic Regression
In this session, you will learn a few basic concepts related to logistic regression. Broadly speaking, the topics that will be covered in this session are:

* Binary classification
* Sigmoid function
* Likelihood function
* Building a logistic regression model in Python
* Odds and log odds

## Binary Classification
The most common use of logistic regression models is in binary classification problems.

#### Examples of Classification
1. Finance company wants to know whether a customer is default or not.
2. Predicting an email is spam or not.
3. Categorizing email into promotional, personal and official.

A classification problem where we have two possible outputs/outcomes is called as **Binary Classification problem.**
* Examples
    1. Customer default or not.
    2. Spam/ham example.
    3. Categorizing email into promotional, personal and official. This is not a binary classification problem but a multi class classification problem.


[Diabetes Data](dataset/DiabetesExampleData.csv)

Now, recall the graph of the diabetes example. Suppose there is another person, with a blood sugar level of 195, and you do not know whether that person has diabetes or not. What would you do then? Would you classify him/her as a diabetic or as a non-diabetic?

Now, based on the boundary, you may be tempted to declare this person a diabetic, but can you really do that? This person’s sugar level (195 mg/dL) is very close to the threshold (200 mg/dL), below which people are declared as non-diabetic. It is, therefore, quite possible that this person was just a non-diabetic with a slightly high blood sugar level. After all, the data does have people with slightly high sugar levels (220 mg/dL), who are not diabetics.

## Sigmoid Curve
In the last section, you saw what a binary classification problem is, and then you saw an example of a binary classification problem, where a model is trying to predict whether a person has diabetes or not based on his/her blood sugar level. We saw how using a **simple boundary decision method** would not work in this case.

Since the **sigmoid curve** has all the properties you would want — extremely low values in the start, extremely high values in the end, and intermediate values in the middle — it’s a good choice for modelling the value of the **probability of diabetes.**

This is the sigmoid curve equation:

So now we have verified, with actual values, that the sigmoid curve actually has the properties we discussed earlier, i.e. extremely low values in the start, extremely high values in the end, and intermediate values in the middle.

However, you may be wondering — why can’t you just fit a straight line here? This would also have the same properties — low values in the start, high ones towards the end, and intermediate ones in the middle.

The main problem with a straight line is that it is not steep enough. In the sigmoid curve, as you can see, you have low values for a lot of points, then the values rise all of a sudden, after which you have a lot of high values. In a straight line though, the values rise from low to high very uniformly, and hence, the “boundary” region, the one where the probabilities transition from high to low is not present.
