# Logistic Regression

Logistic regression, which is a classification model, i.e. it will help you make predictions in cases where the output is a categorical variable.Since logistic regression is the most easily interpretable of all classification models, it is very commonly used in various industries such as banking, healthcare, etc.

## Introduction: Univariate Logistic Regression
In this session, you will learn a few basic concepts related to logistic regression. Broadly speaking, the topics that will be covered in this session are:

* Binary classification
* Sigmoid function
* Likelihood function
* Building a logistic regression model in Python
* Odds and log odds

## Binary Classification
The most common use of logistic regression models is in binary classification problems.

#### Examples of Classification
1. Finance company wants to know whether a customer is default or not.
2. Predicting an email is spam or not.
3. Categorizing email into promotional, personal and official.

A classification problem where we have two possible outputs/outcomes is called as **Binary Classification problem.**
* Examples
    1. Customer default or not.
    2. Spam/ham example.
    3. Categorizing email into promotional, personal and official. This is not a binary classification problem but a multi class classification problem.


[Diabetes Data](dataset\DiabetesExampleData.csv)

Now, recall the graph of the diabetes example. Suppose there is another person, with a blood sugar level of 195, and you do not know whether that person has diabetes or not. What would you do then? Would you classify him/her as a diabetic or as a non-diabetic?

Now, based on the boundary, you may be tempted to declare this person a diabetic, but can you really do that? This personâ€™s sugar level (195 mg/dL) is very close to the threshold (200 mg/dL), below which people are declared as non-diabetic. It is, therefore, quite possible that this person was just a non-diabetic with a slightly high blood sugar level. After all, the data does have people with slightly high sugar levels (220 mg/dL), who are not diabetics.
